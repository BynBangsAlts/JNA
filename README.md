[JNA](https://discord.gg/jgXehmAJPw) Java Native Transpiler & Bytecode Obfuscator
[JNA](https://discord.gg/jgXehmAJPw) is a relatively new Java obfuscator that stands out as one of the few transpilers offering both Native Obfuscation and Bytecode Obfuscation. It includes advanced features such as RuntimeInvoker and VirtualProtector.

While [JNA](https://discord.gg/jgXehmAJPw) can be used alongside other obfuscators, this isn't typically recommended because [JNA](https://discord.gg/jgXehmAJPw) itself provides comprehensive application protection. However, it's important to remember that no obfuscator can guarantee 100% protection.

In addition to its native capabilities, [JNA](https://discord.gg/jgXehmAJPw) offers bytecode obfuscation features including:

- Call Graph Integrity Transformer

- Flow Flattening

- Invoke Dynamic Transformer

And More


Example of How [JNA](https://discord.gg/jgXehmAJPw) works

Before 

```yaml
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
``` 

After 

```yaml
public class HelloWorld {
    public static native void main(String[] var0);

    static {
        Loader.a(HelloWorld.class);
        RuntimeInvoker.register((int)-1157484147, (int)-1724480095);
        VirtualProtect.register((int)2018008000, (int)-129476461);
        HelloWorld.$JNA();
    }

    public static native void $JNA();
}
```
